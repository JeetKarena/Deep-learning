1. **Structure**:
   - The repository contains folders for "Perceptron" and "TensorFlow."
   - It includes a `.gitignore` file, a `LICENSE` file under GPL-3.0, and a `README.md` file.

2. **Contents**:
   - Jupyter Notebook files (100% of the codebase).

To proceed with creating an amazing `README.md`, I'll incorporate a comprehensive overview, usage instructions, and relevant links, also aligning with the requirements of the job posting. Here's a draft:
